# Cafe Dumaguete Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to improve the sales performance of **Cafe Dumaguete**, a mid-sized coffee shop chain with three branches in Dumaguete City. The cafe has experienced fluctuating sales over the past year, and the owner, Mr. Cofino, wants to understand the factors that drive sales and how analytics can support better decision-making.

The analysis covers **descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics**, including actionable recommendations for increasing sales.

## Background
Cafe Dumaguete collected a dataset containing:

- Daily sales (₱)
- Number of customers
- Weather conditions (sunny, rainy, cloudy)
- Day of the week
- Marketing promotions (yes/no)
